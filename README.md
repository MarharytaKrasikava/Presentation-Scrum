Hello to everyone. Now I'm going to present you Scrum development methodology. And it's an agile way to manage the project. And first I want to
tell you a little about history of methodologies. And in 1970 Winston Royce offered a waterfall model. And according to this model all the team was divided
by the functional items, and the tasks passed from one item to to another by stages. And each stage lasted a certain amount of time and team can't go back to
another, to previous stage without starting all the process from the beginning. So we can see that it's not agile methodology in the difference from agile methodology that was created by an Agile Aliens in 2001 and it is written in a Agile manifesto that assignment for values:
 - individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
 - working software over comprehensive documentation
 - customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
 - responding to change over following a plan
 And what the things is on the right is more value than the values on the left but it doesn't mean that they are not value at all. And we see in compare with agile with
waterfall that agile is more successful, more often bringing to success the projects then waterfall model. So what is Scrum? Scrum is an Agile methodology as I said before and in the agile of methodology there is now completed description what should team should do on each stage and no detail information how things to be done. And all these functions are left to scrum development team. It has to be self organized and cross-functional. Self-organizing - that means that there is no team leader who tell everybody what they should do every day. And scrum team decided everyday how they want to act. And scrum master helps team not to hesitate from the right direction, shelter the team from
from the outside distractions and helps team to perform by its best and helps team to follow scrum principles. Project owner is a one more important role in teamwork. In
scrum system product owner tells the team as can I say keeps team in right direction of development to to create right product, to prioritize all the tasks that customer requires. 
And next I will tell you about all the process of scrum model. And the first is product itself. And product backlog is described in the project by the list of features
and this product backlog is created by a product owner to describe all the features and give the team complete understanding what they should do. And all the work of team is
splitted to several amount of timepieces. And sprint is lasted from two to four weeks. and during the sprint team has to build coded, tested and shippable product. Not shippable
 but potentially shippable product. And at the start of each sprint team has a planning meeting. During the planning meeting team builds sprint backlog. During this in the
sprint backlog there is list of a small amount of features that team can implement during one sprint. And during the daily scrum meeting that lasted not more than 15 minutes the team is talking about what they should do that day and what they did the day before. And this meeting to synchronize the work of all the team. And after the average sprint in the sprint review where team demonstrates potentially shippable product to project owner and gives feedback that can influence on the next sprint. Sprint retrospective is an event where all the other roles are represented: this product owner, team and Scrum master. And there team is just discussing all the opportunities to improve the work and all the distractions that are in the team. Sprint burn down chart and release burn down chart are the instruments that help to control the time to be always to looking after the all the list of features that are not
released yet, are not ready. 
So I can say that scrum methodology is a racecar where car is a team of itself and driver is a product owner that leads team to the right direction to make right product. And scrum master is a chief mechanic who helps all the car be well-tuned and perform as its best.
Thank you for attention
